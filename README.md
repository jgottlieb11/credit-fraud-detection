## Overview

This project focuses on building and evaluating machine learning models for credit card fraud detection. It utilizes several classifiers, including logistic regression, support vector machines, random forests, and multilayer perceptrons (MLP), to classify fraudulent transactions. The key steps involve feature scaling, data resampling to handle class imbalance, dimensionality reduction using t-SNE, and evaluation using confusion matrices, precision-recall, and ROC curves.

## Dataset

The dataset used is a [publicly available dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud) containing credit card transactions. It includes the following columns:
- **V1-V28**: Features generated by PCA to protect confidentiality.
- **Time**: The time in seconds between this transaction and the first transaction.
- **Amount**: The transaction amount.
- **Class**: Target variable where 1 indicates fraud and 0 indicates a normal transaction.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/jgottlieb11/credit-fraud-detection.git
    cd credit-fraud-detection
    ```

2. **Set up the environment**:
    Create and activate a virtual environment, and install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv env
    source env/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Run Jupyter Notebook**:
    Start Jupyter Notebook to view and run the project:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

## Data Preprocessing

1. **Handling Class Imbalance**: 
   The dataset is highly imbalanced, with fraudulent transactions being much rarer than legitimate ones. To address this, **SMOTE** (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) and undersampling techniques are used.

2. **Feature Scaling**:
   We used `StandardScaler` to standardize the features except for `Class`, `Time`, and `Amount`.

3. **Dimensionality Reduction**:
   **t-SNE** (t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) was applied to visualize the high-dimensional data in 2D space.

## Models Implemented

The following machine learning models were implemented for classification:

- **Logistic Regression**
- **Random Forest Classifier**
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
- **Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)**

Each model was trained on the resampled data and evaluated for performance.

## Visualizations

- **Class Distribution**: Visualizations for the imbalance in the dataset.
- **t-SNE Plot**: Visualizes the dimensionality-reduced data.
- **Precision-Recall Curves**: To assess model performance in imbalanced data.
- **ROC Curves**: To evaluate the model's ability to differentiate between the classes.

## Evaluation Metrics

- **Confusion Matrix**: Used to visualize the performance of each classifier.
- **Precision-Recall Curve**: Evaluates precision vs recall for different thresholds.
- **ROC Curve**: A graphical plot showing the diagnostic ability of classifiers.

## How to Use

1. Run the Jupyter notebook `fraud_detection.ipynb` to explore the dataset, preprocessing steps, and the models.
2. You can modify the models or add your own in the notebook.
3. Visualizations and evaluation metrics for each model will be displayed as output within the notebook.
